	The following journals have been marked as not having any rankings up to our standards. If you feel any of these are in error, you can edit them. When I make a button for it.

			{{item[0].journalName}}

<h5> No Match for these. Try searching with different names. Otherwise, clink the button to confirm that this journal is not ranked high enough and we will disregard it in future searches. </h5>

	Once you've finished above, click "Show Ranks." (if you click this early, the links for the pdfs won't be complete. You can just toggle the reveal by clicking it twice, though.)
